[2025-06-24 13:39:55] Final validation failed: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 96.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 4.00 GiB of which 2.34 GiB is free. Of the allocated memory 593.53 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 250.47 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
